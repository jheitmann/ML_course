Machine Learning, Project 1
===========================

### Files provided

  - implementations.py
    This file contains our main machine learning functions and their helper subfunctions. It is split into parts:
        - Helper functions : miscallenious reusable functions
        - Loss functions : losses used within our various models
        - Gradient functions : gradient computing functions used within our models
        - Model training functions : the models implementations 
        - Cross validation functions : the cross validation functions used to compute   optimal hyperparameters for our models
  - run.py
    This file contains the code that generates results.csv, which contains our best model predictions for the testing dataset.
  - benchmark.ipynb
    This notebook contains our history of training models and testing their accuracy, with increasing levels of feature processing, searching for the best performance. It is loosely chronologiscal, from earlier tries to later ones at the bottom.
